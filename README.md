# TF2 Rainbowizer-Chaos by Makiavelli

This a HUD that gives an animated rainbow UI and a script which a random effect every 30 seconds upon starting the timer.

NOTE: This is not exactly "random" but I did the best I can with source scripting limitations.

# How do I download the mod?
Head on over to the `Releases` tab or [click here](https://github.com/Makiavellii/tf2-rainbomizer/releases/latest)!  

Installation is as simple as extracting the contents of the .zip file to your custom folder
For example: `steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom` <- extract contents of the .zip file like this.

# How do I use it?
1. Add `exec hud` to your autoexec.
2. Start the game
3. While in a server, press the `Randomizer` button.
4. Suffer.

# Is there a list of effects?
Absolutely. Here's a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X0MceA-hdKg7duC4V9okAgpRPPvWNeV_lPN8DNv6Txk/edit?usp=sharing) that has them all.

# The rainbow UI has stopped working...
If the rainbow UI breaks (which it will) just press 'c' to restart the rainbow animation.

# Why is my FPS locked to 145?
Your FPS is going to be locked at 145 so the wait timer can properly count since it's based on your FPS and not on server ticks like most people believe.

# Why am I getting some FPS stutters?
You might experience FPS stutters since there's a lot of animations updating and scripts going off in the background but it all adds to the chaos!

# Why are the sound effects not working?
The custom sound effects could be blocked by sv_pure. Not much I can do about that, unfortunately.
